# Flysoft Floorplan
## Project Overview
The Floorplan Application was developed during an internship at Flysoft Systems from October 2024 to December 2024. This project aimed to create an intuitive application that allows restaurant owners to design, customize, and manage their restaurant layouts seamlessly. It involved developing a cross-platform solution using Flutter and Dart, targeting Android, Windows, and Linux platforms.

## Key Features
1. Drag-and-Drop Interface: A user-friendly interface to position tables.
2. Customizable Layouts: Supports resizing, and color customization of layout elements.
3. Platform Independence: The application runs smoothly on multiple platforms, including mobile and desktop environments.
4. Interactive Visuals: The app integrates interactive designs.

## Personal Contributions
During the project, I took on the role of a Full Stack Developer, contributing to:
- UI/UX Implementation: Translating designs from Figma into responsive layouts using Flutter.
- Logic Development: Building efficient and reusable code components.
- Testing and Debugging: Ensuring a bug-free experience across all supported platforms.

Note: Unfortunately, the application’s source code cannot be shared on GitHub or other public platforms as it was developed as part of an internship, and the ownership lies with Flysoft Systems.
